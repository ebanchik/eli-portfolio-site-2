            <h3>Hello, I'm Eli, a New York City native and a recent graduate from NYU Gallatin with a diverse background in Business, Philosophy, and Psychology. My journey into the tech world began organically, sparked by my experiences in a marketing internship at a fintech startup where creativity thrived. I directed creative projects, conducted research, wrote compelling copy, and regularly pitched ideas. My analytical side shines through roles in investment analysis at EMBEE and data management at NewLab.

            <br />
            Personally, I've co-founded an event production company in high school, contributed to a large tech incubator, emerged victorious in a startup sprint, and completed a coding bootcamp. The allure of coding hit me during that sprint, witnessing my teammates transform an idea into an MVP in a day. It was a revelation â€“ a perfect blend of creativity and skill. Since then, I've wholeheartedly committed myself to coding, seeking a workplace where I can continue to learn and grow.
            <br />
            <br />

            At 23, I'm eager to embark on a software engineering journey, embracing challenges and contributing to innovative solutions. With a solid foundation in both creativity and logic, I am ready to bring a unique perspective to any team. I value collaborative learning, and at this early stage in my career, I'm on the lookout for a company culture that fosters personal and professional development. Let's build something great together.</h3>
